    Every Tuesday during lunch, our dev team crashes the main conference room, and we sit and talk for an hour straight. Talking might not be the best word to describe what we do though. We argue, we yell, we empathize, we laugh, we remember, we teach, we learn, we praise, and dare I say, we bond.

    We have discussed everything from clean code, to clean working environments. Absolutely nothing is off limits in these conversations. The less experienced developers have the opportunity to listen to lessons learned from the more experienced. More experienced developers have the opportunity to hear concerns and stresses of the less experienced. These conversations have forced us to solidify a strong foundation for why we believe in what we believe in, as a team. Obviously these types of talks can and should occur during pair programming, code reviews and retrospectives, but a lot of those conversations are reactive. We have found that that while we are relating to the concepts that have been brought out in book club, it is allowing us the time to approach these major items in a proactive manner. This has made a huge difference in how we plan features. We have already had the arguments about how certain things should be implemented, and because of that, we already have a team decision on how to approach the problem.

    Reading books has been a crucial part of my development career. Being able to dig into others opinions and suggestions on topics that they have become well versed in is such a luxury. But even better than me reading and interpreting their opinions, book club allows the luxury of hearing my team's opinions and suggestions. You aren't just reading a book now; you are reading your team. Comparing and contrasting our opinions has led us to form well thought out conclusions to some of the industries most debated issues. Nothing has built our team chemistry more than these conversations.

    To run a successful book club for your team, you will need to keep a close eye on burnout. Let's be honest here, reading and debating technical books one right after another can really be tiring. We have read quite a few large, dense books and meetings can tend to be sparse near the end of those. We have tried to counteract this by finding ways to get more engagement. Sometimes we do coding practices that directly relate to the concept from the book. We also try to alternate between highly technical and easier to read books. This has proven to be one of the only 'rules' that we have about book club, and it has proven to be very beneficial.

    Talk your company into providing the books. Most companies have budgets for training or education, this should be at the top of one of those lists. This is so much more than just buying a book for you to read. It's about creating a culture on your team that loves to learn, and find new ways to improve everything that you do as a company. If your company doesn't want that, then I'd strongly encourage you to find a new one that does. Our new developers always have a copy of our current book on their desk when they show up for the first day. It shows that our company cares about you being the best you that you can be, and that means everything.
